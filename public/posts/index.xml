      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;team-171---cheese-curd-herd&#34;&gt;Team 171 - Cheese Curd Herd&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first official robotics experience was with my local FIRST Robotics team, FRC Team 171. It was a joint effort between Platteville High School students and UW-Platteville students who were our mentors. This is where I got my first experience with CAD, 3D printing, machining, programming, and electronics. Once I got the robotics bug, I was hooked and never went back. The team was very close-knit and I was able to make some great friends and memories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

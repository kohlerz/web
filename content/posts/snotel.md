During the summer after my Senior year of High School, I was given the opportunity to work with the UW-Platteville's Wisconsin Applied Research Institute on a project to create a more robust and reliable data logger for SNOTEL sites. I took the project over from a previous graduate student and was tasked with taking the prototype and refining it to be more reliable and easier to use in the field. This was an ambitious project for me at the time, but I was excited to take it on.

With my trusty 3D printer in hand, I designed some new waterproof scales that would be able to withstand the elements and be easily deployed in the field. I also worked on refining the electronics and software to be more reliable and easier to use.

Each scale was connected to a central data logger that would collect the data from all of the scales and transmit it to a central server via satellite. The data logger was housed in a waterproof enclosure and was powered by a solar panel.

By the end of the summer, I had a working prototype that was ready for field testing. It was a great learning experience for me and I was proud of what I was able to accomplish. The device worked quite well and was able to collect data until the temperature dropped low enough to freeze the electolyte in the battery.

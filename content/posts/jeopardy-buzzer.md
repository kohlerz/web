### Project for Platteville High School

My physics professor propositioned me and a friend to make this device that could be reliable enough and easy to use for my high-school's pep rallies and assemblies

At the time I had been working more and more with my 3D printer, so I took on the challenge and designed the mechanical and electrical aspects of the device. I used ethernet jacks with crimp connectors to ensure there was little chance of solder joints decaying over time. The ethernet jacks were used to connect to the main hub which contained an arduino to do all the processing. The device was simple to use and started the sequence as soon as power was applied.

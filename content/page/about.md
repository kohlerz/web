My name is Kohler Zuehlke. I have the following qualities:

- I'm 6'7"
- I have a cat named Grommet

I like robots, like **a lot**. I also like to tinker with electronics and 3D printing. I graduated from UW-Madison with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in December 2025. Right now I'm helping Wisconsin Robotics transition through the new rover design, and I'm also working on a few personal projects that might show up here one day.

I also take pictures sometimes
